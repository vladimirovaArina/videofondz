            The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is long-range, high-altitude, strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed and manufactured <br>
            by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both United States Air Force(USAF) and <br> NASA.

            The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 recconaissence aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's <br> Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for many of the aircraft's <br> innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the aircraft to be designed <br> with reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of the aircraft was under  consideration, before the program <br> was focused solely on recconaissence. Mission equipment for the recconaissence role included signals intelligence sensors, a <br> side-looking  airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than tha A-12, allowing it hold more <br> fuel as well  as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff <br> General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic Recconaissence) designation over simply RS (Recconaissence). The <br> aircraft was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
